## 📊 Project Overview

NASA’s Kepler mission has provided data for thousands of potential exoplanets. In this project, we:

- Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset
- Analyzed planetary properties like radius, orbital period, and habitability factors
- Built an interactive HTML dashboard to visualize insights
